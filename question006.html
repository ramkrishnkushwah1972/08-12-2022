	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>
		A multinational corporation is one that has business offices<br/> 
		and operations in two or more countries in the world.<br/> 
		These companies are often managed from a central office<br/> 
		headquartered in the home country. Simply exporting goods<br/> 
		for sale abroad does not make a business a multinational company.

	<h2>Vision</h2>
	<p>
		To provide the best training in latest cutting adge technologies across the globe and help learners<br/>
		carve their career.
